# PDF Chat

Chat with a PDF file using Azure OpenAI and Langchain

To make this run, add a `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
```

If you do not have an OpenAI account, go to https://platform.openai.com. You need an account for both the embeddings and the calls to the chat model (gpt-3.5-turbo).

Install Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
